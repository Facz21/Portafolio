# Portfolio

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal portfolio.

This project is a simple web page where I share a bit about myself, my interests, and some of the projects I have been working on. I am currently learning web development, so this portfolio is part of my learning journey.

## What can you find here?

- **About Me:** A short introduction about who I am and what motivates me to learn programming.
- **Projects:** Examples of exercises and projects I have completed while learning HTML and CSS. Each project includes a brief description and the main technologies used.
- **Skills:** A list of the technologies and tools I am starting to use and practice.
- **Contact:** How you can reach out to me, whether to offer suggestions, feedback, or just to say hello.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this portfolio is to practice and improve my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as to have a space where I can track my progress and share it with others. As I grow and learn more, I plan to update and enhance this portfolio.

## Note

I am still a beginner in web development. This portfolio is a work in progress, and I am open to feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for taking the time to visit!
